AT&T API Platform SDK for HTML5
====

The AT&T API Platform SDK for HTML5 is designed to provide an easy way to develop 
Sencha Touch applications that can access the AT&T APIs using JavaScript. The HTML5
experience for AT&T developers focuses on an enhanced capability to leverage the AT&T
network-based services to create feature-rich apps. Access to services like SMS, 
Terminal Location, and MMS, in conjunction with the ability to enable direct carrier 
billing, provides a multitude of options not normally available to mobile web 
application developers.

To get started, open docs/index.html in a web browser.
