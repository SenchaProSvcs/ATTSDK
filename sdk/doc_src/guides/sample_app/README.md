#Sample Apps 


Sample Apps are Sencha Touch standalone applications that exercise the AT&T APIs. For a general introduction on how to build a Sencha Touch Application, see [Sencha Touch Hello World](http://www.sencha.com/learn/hello-world).

##Code Organization

Sample Apps code is located in the **webcontent** folder. The server side code is located under **server** and each flavor is responsible to serve statically the client code.

Under the mentioned **webcontent** folder the standalone Sample Apps are organized by feature. You will find a very simple _index.html_ which lists each sample app and its corresponding documentation link.

###Sample App feature folder
Under each feature folder (e.g. **SMS**) you will find a folder per each sample implementation (_App1_, _App2_, etc.) Each implementation has its own documentation under the **doc** folder.
