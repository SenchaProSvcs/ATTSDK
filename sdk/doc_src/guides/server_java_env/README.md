Java Setup
===

A version of the JDK needs to be installed on the computer running the example application.

**Note** You only need Ant if you plan to build and run the application from the command line.  If you aren't going to use the command line, or if you don't have cigwin setup on windows to execute shell scripts, we recommend you use Eclipse to build and run the application.
